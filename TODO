* worker shall also contain some kind of API for the post Shirt processing.
* move lines2df to opencv library?
* put plot of mask along with rho, theta graphs
* remove development stuff like myopencv and scratch -- maybe later
* give the manually defined regions in percent (for development its easier 
  in pixel right now) -- actually better to give in pixel of the standard image
  size. Then scale the region definition and everything else.. -- already done 
* monte_watershed_it has object and background indication point generation
  hard coded. Needs to be parameterized
* calculate the percentage of data points in each bucket of the rho/theta diagram
* calculate percentage of  rho/theta data-points in each region
    show this data as bar plot under the first graph

- finish manual categorization.
