* categorize using machine learning
* manually determined categories shall be put 
  in an input file, e.g. csv file.
* worker shall be some kind of API for tshirt image 
  processing.
* opencv might suit better in lib. --functional programming
* move lines2df to opencv library?
* put plot of mask along with rho, theta graphs
* move opencv to lib
* remove development stuff like myopencv and scratch -- maybe later
* give the manually defined regions in percent (for development its easier 
  in pixel right now)
* monte_watershed_it has object and background indication point generation
  hard coded. Needs to be parameterized
* calculate the percentage of data points in each bucket of the rho/theta diagram


- remove hard coded min max axis values.
  where: helper/8 main/123
- scale rho, more precisely the respective axes, if image
  size is not 3000x4000
- finish manual categorization.
- cleanup main.
